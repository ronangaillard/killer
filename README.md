# Killer

This is a basic and dirty Killer (Assassin) helper.

## Building

`gcc main.c -o main` will build the app with no issues.

## Setup

Put the name of each player on a new line in `names.txt`.

Some forfeits are already filled in `forfeits.txt` but feel free to add plenty. (one per line).

## Running

Just run `./main` and follow the instructions on screen :)

Type `-1` to exit the app.
